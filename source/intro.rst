Introduction
============
The ViaLactea Software is developed in two main components: the ViaLactea Visual Analytics tool (following referred as VLVA) for visualization and analysis exploring the correlation between different data and the ViaLactea Knowledge Base (VLKB) for managing the data.

VLVA, based on VisIVO backbone, offers a 2D and 3D visual analytics environment allowing the astronomers to easily conduct research activities interacting in a simple way with the VLKB and the Search&Cutout services.

For more details about the ViaLactea Visual Analytics Tool and its aspects please refere to `F. Vitello et al. 2018 PASP 130 084503 <https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1538-3873/aac5d2>`_.
